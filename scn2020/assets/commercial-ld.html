<h3>Transit Scooter Hub</h3>
<p>These scooter hubs serve commercial areas of lower density. They are typically 10-20 docks in size. They use the RFID fence design for parking, which means that scooters are parked in a deliniated zone on the street, which contains rfid sensors. This reduces the infrastructure cost while ensuring scooters are not all over the place!</p>
