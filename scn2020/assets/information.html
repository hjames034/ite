<h2>A Hypothetical Application of Our Planning Methods</h2>
<p>As USC students, we chose to study the area around USC, which we believe contains a variety of different neighborhood
and land use types. The area immediately around USC can be categorized as a "Mixed Use/University" area, which would attract the highest
amount of demand for e-scooters, while the neighborhood of Jefferson Park is a high-density, low-rise, residential neighborhood that isn't well
served by Metro Rail, but is close to downtown Los Angeles and USC, which are two major employment centers in the area. Finally, the region around the I-10
freeway is a more industrial, low-density commercial area. Thus, the USC/Jefferson Park area encompasses a wide range of the neighborhood types in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In our map, we not only placed scooter stations, but also color-coded them by land use type . We believe that categorizing scooter stations by land use will enable us to predict usage, and thus station size.
Based on the usage patterns of successful bike-share systems, we realized that places of employment and destinations such as transit stations and universities would have a higher demand than a residential docking station.
Additionally, we strived to place the stations such that every neighborhood was well-served by scooter stations, which achieves our goal of greater <b>transportation equity</b> in neighborhoods that lack the same transit
access that USC and the Exposition Line corridor have. </p>
<p>In addition, we also realized that we needed to build out beginner-friendly physical infrastructure. The USC/Jefferson Park area currently has a "bare-bones" network concentrated on the western side of the Harbor Freeway, with 
one protected bike lane on Figuroea St. Our plan provides a few baseline designs for wide, medium, and narrow roads based on our <a href="https://iteusc.com/bridger-main/">design treatments for Bridger and Main Streets</a>in the ITE 2020 Micromobility Competition. In general,
we propose a more equitable bike lane network that will also be accessible to non-scooter share users. Because lower income communities have a lower rate of car ownership and are more transit dependent, our bike lane plan benefits the community of South LA and Jefferson Park, as the addition
of protected bike lanes on Jefferson Blvd, MLK Blvd, Main Street, and San Pedro Street, along with many others, will increase intra-neighborhood connectivity. Features such as Protected or grade separated intersections will encourage maximum adaptation of our scooter system, as 
residents will not have the "safety barrier" impeding them from using e-scooters on the road.</p>
<p>Another feature of our project is narrower traffic lanes. This, along with reduced sidewalk riding and haphazard e-scooter parking, will increase pedestrian safety. Narrower lanes mean that vehicle throughput(# of lanes is maintained), while speed limits are reduced. This has the side effect of
reducing fatailites and making streets more pedestrian friendly</p>
