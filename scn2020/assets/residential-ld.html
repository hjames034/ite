<h3>Low Density Residential Hub</h3>
<p>These scooter stations serve single family and small multifamily homes. Docks should be placed near intersections, and the placement of docks should form a high density network such that no user will have to walk more than 3 minutes to a station. These stations are highly flexible, and should be placed at the will of the community. They are small in size, and require less infrastructure (just an RFID fence) than the larger stations.</p>
